# Multiplication practice 

Python 3.4.3 text-based program for practicing multiplication tables from 1-12. 
Users can practice either: 
* random multiplication facts _or_ 
* random multiplication facts for a single family of facts. 

This project is an on-going one (08.02.2016).  

## Usage 

Program can be run directly from a shell with: 
`python3 multiplication_practice.py`

Select which mode you would like to run, then follow onscreen directions for gameplay. 
Once a mode is selected, press 'Q' at any time to quit the game.

## To do: 
- [ ] Improve code! (Particularly using functions for freq. occurring actions, and general efficiency).

- [ ] Randomize user feedback. 

- [ ] Show countdown timer to user.  

- [ ] Handle user inaction (i.e. idle hands). 

- [ ] Develop GUI (Cross-platform for desktops at this time). Eventually web app? 

_Comments, etc. are most welcome._
